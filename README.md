#Ruby & Rails Sandbox

This repo is just intended to document me getting back up to speed on some Rails basics. It's mostly following the default Rails tutorial at [guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html](http://guides.rubyonraisl.org/getting_started.html), but includes some custom routes & renders of my own. 

The code in this repo IS NOT PRODUCTION QUALITY. DO NOT USE THIS LIVE. It is unprotected from CSRF on some routes and has no CORS restrictions. It is also half-baked and frankly you could build it out yourself using 'rails new' in less time than it would take you to clone and modify. 

Just, you know, be smart and stuff. :neckbeard:
